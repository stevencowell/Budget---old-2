# 404 Error Fix - Complete Solution

## 🎯 Problem Solved
The Superannuation Tracker button was showing a 404 error because GitHub Pages wasn't set up.

## ✨ What Was Fixed

### 1. Created GitHub Actions Deployment Workflow
**File:** `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

This automated workflow:
- ✅ Builds both the main Budget app and React Superannuation app
- ✅ Deploys everything to GitHub Pages automatically
- ✅ Runs every time you push to the main branch
- ✅ Can also be triggered manually from the Actions tab

### 2. Configured React App for GitHub Pages
**File:** `client/package.json`

Added:
```json
"homepage": "/superannuation/app"
```

This tells React where the app will be hosted.

### 3. Updated Button URL
**File:** `main.js`

Changed the Superannuation button to point to the correct production URL:
- Development: `http://localhost:3000`
- Production: `/superannuation/app`

## 🚀 How to Deploy

#### Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to your repo: https://github.com/stevencowell/superannuation
