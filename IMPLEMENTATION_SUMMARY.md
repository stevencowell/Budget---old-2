## 💡 Key Calculations Implemented

### 1. Accumulation Phase (Pre-Retirement)
```javascript
For each year until retirement:
  Starting Balance
  × (1 + Return Rate - Fee Rate)           // Apply growth and fees
  + (Fortnightly Contribution × 26)        // Add annual contributions
  × Part-Time Ratio                        // Adjust if part-time
  + LSL Super Boost (year 0 only)          // Add LSL contribution
  = End Year Balance
```

**Implementation Details:**
- Compound growth applied annually
- Part-time work reduces contributions proportionally
- LSL contribution added in first year with growth
- Separate tracking for Steve and Anne
- Year-by-year projection stored for charting

### 2. Long Service Leave Super Boost
```javascript
Daily Salary = Annual Salary ÷ 260 working days
LSL Payment = Daily Salary × LSL Days
Super Contribution = LSL Payment × 11% (employer SG)
Boosted Value = Super Contribution × (1 + net return)^years_to_retirement
```

**Example:** 
- Steve with 60 days LSL at $85,000 salary
- Daily rate: $327
- LSL payment: $19,615
- Super boost: $2,158 (growing to ~$2,900 by retirement)

### 3. Part-Time Work Impact
```javascript
Part-Time Ratio = Days per Week ÷ 5
Adjusted Contribution = Normal Contribution × Part-Time Ratio

Applied from: Part-Time Start Age → Retirement Age
```

**Example:**
- 4 days per week = 80% of full-time
- $500 fortnightly becomes $400 fortnightly
- Over 2 years: ~$10,400 less contributed
- With growth: ~$55,000 less at retirement

### 4. Sustainable Retirement Income
```javascript
Net Real Return = Return Rate - Fees - Inflation
Years in Retirement = Life Expectancy - Retirement Age

Sustainable Income = Balance × r / (1 - (1 + r)^-n)

Where:
  r = Net Real Return (e.g., 7% - 0.6% - 2.5% = 3.9%)
  n = Years in Retirement (e.g., 90 - 60 = 30)
```

**Formula Type:** Present Value of Annuity (PMT calculation)

**Result:** 
- Income that stays constant in real terms (inflation-adjusted)
- Balance reaches $0 exactly at life expectancy
- Accounts for ongoing investment returns during retirement

**Example:**
- Balance: $750,000
- Net real return: 3.9%
- Years: 30
- **Sustainable Income: ~$46,800/year**
