### Expected Results (approximate):
**Steve's LSL Impact:**

- LSL payment: 65 × $327 = $21,231
- Super contribution: $21,231 × 11% = $2,335
- **Extra in super: ~$2,900** (with growth to 60)

**Anne's LSL Impact:**
- Daily salary: $80,000 / 260 = $308
- LSL payment: 50 × $308 = $15,385

### Trade-Off Analysis:

## Making Your Decision: Key Questions

### Financial Questions:
1. **What's our minimum comfortable income?**
   - Current expenses minus work-related costs?
   - Add healthcare, travel budget?
   - Include buffer for emergencies?

2. **Will we have Age Pension?**
   - At 67, likely eligible for part pension
   - Assets test: homeowner couple can have ~$1M assets for part pension
   - Adds ~$5,000-$15,000/year depending on super balance

3. **Any other income sources?**
   - Inheritance expected?
   - Investment properties?
   - Part-time work in retirement?
   - Downsizing family home?

### Lifestyle Questions:
1. **How do we feel about work right now?**
   - Enjoying it → Work longer (Scenario 5)
   - Struggling → Part-time transition (Scenario 2/6)
   - Counting days → Early if feasible (Scenario 4)

2. **What will we do in retirement?**
   - Expensive hobbies → Need higher income
   - Simple pleasures → Can manage on less
   - Big travel plans → May need LSL cash

3. **How's our health?**
   - Excellent → Can work longer
   - Concerning → Prioritize early retirement
   - Need to consider → Build healthcare buffer

### Risk Tolerance:
1. **How comfortable with financial uncertainty?**
   - Conservative → Maximize super (Scenario 1 or 5)
   - Moderate → Balance approach (Scenario 2 or 6)
   - Adventurous → Early with lower income (Scenario 4)

2. **What if we live longer than 90?**
   - Age Pension safety net from 67
   - Can reduce spending if needed
   - Might downsize home

3. **What if markets perform poorly?**
   - Conservative calculator estimates help
   - Retirement spending can flex
   - Part-time work if needed

## Recommended Approach

### Step 1: Model All These Scenarios
Save each scenario in the calculator and compare side-by-side.

### Step 2: Shortlist Your Top 3
Based on initial numbers, pick your 3 favorites.

### Step 3: Test Sensitivities
For each shortlisted scenario:
- Reduce return rate to 5% (bear market)
- Increase life expectancy to 95 (living longer)
- Add $5,000/year for unexpected costs
- See which scenarios still work

### Step 4: Have The Conversation
Discuss together:
- "How would we spend our time if we went part-time?"
- "What would we do with an extra $5,000/year in retirement?"
- "Is it worth working 2 more years for $X extra?"

### Step 5: Make a Decision (But Stay Flexible)
- Choose your primary strategy
- Set a review point (e.g., age 57)
- Circumstances change - be ready to adapt

## The Bottom Line

**Good News:**
All scenarios show you'll have retirement income! The question is finding the right balance between:
- Working longer vs retiring sooner
- Higher income vs more free time
- Financial security vs lifestyle now

**There's no "perfect" answer** - only what's right for you both.

Use the calculator to see the numbers, then make the decision with your hearts about how you want to spend these precious years.

**Remember:** The best retirement plan is one you'll actually stick to and enjoy. Don't optimize for money alone - optimize for the life you want to live.
