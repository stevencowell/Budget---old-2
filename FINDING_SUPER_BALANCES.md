# Finding Your Superannuation Balances from Tax Returns

## Quick Reference for Steve and Anne

Your tax return documents are located at:
- `/workspace/Budget-main/Steve's Tax 2024-25.pdf`
- `/workspace/Budget-main/Anne's Tax 2024-25.docx`

## Where to Find Super Information

### 1. In Your Tax Return Documents

Look for these sections:

**Section: Member Contribution Statement**
- Shows member (your) contributions
- Shows employer contributions
- Shows total balance

**Section: Reportable Employer Super Contributions**
- Shows additional contributions beyond SG
- Your $500 fortnightly should appear here

**Section: Super Lump Sum Payments**
- Would show any withdrawals (unlikely before retirement)

### 2. Direct from Aware Super

**Online (Recommended):**
1. Log in to Aware Super member portal
2. Dashboard shows current balance prominently
3. Navigate to "Transactions" for contribution history
4. Download annual statement (usually sent August-September)

**MyGov:**
1. Log in to myGov
2. Link to ATO
3. Navigate to "Super" section
4. View all super accounts and balances
5. Most accurate and up-to-date

**Phone:**
- Aware Super: 1300 650 873
- Have your member number ready
- Ask for current balance and recent contributions

### 3. Annual Member Statement

Aware Super sends annual statements showing:
- Opening balance (as at July 1)
- All contributions throughout year
- Investment returns
- Fees deducted
- Insurance premiums (if applicable)
- Closing balance (as at June 30)

## What Balance to Use

**For the Retirement Planner:**
Use the **most recent balance available**

Example:
- Tax return 2024-25 shows balance as at 30 June 2024
- It's now October 2024
- Add ~3 months of contributions: $500 × 6 fortnights = ~$3,000
- Plus investment returns since June (roughly 1-2% for 3 months)

**Better approach:**
Check your actual current balance via Aware Super portal or MyGov for most accurate projection.

## Expected Contribution Pattern

Based on your stated $500 fortnightly before-tax contributions:

**Annual contributions per person:**
- Fortnightly: $500
- Annual: $500 × 26 = $13,000

**Plus employer Super Guarantee (SG):**
- Current SG rate: 11.5% (2024-25)
- On Steve's $85,000 salary: $9,775
- On Anne's $80,000 salary: $9,200

**Total annual contributions:**
- Steve: $13,000 + $9,775 = $22,775
- Anne: $13,000 + $9,200 = $22,200

These should be reflected in your tax returns and super statements.

## Verifying Your Contributions

**In tax return, check:**
1. **Reportable employer super contributions** 
   - Should show your $13,000 salary sacrifice
2. **Total employment income**
   - Used to calculate SG contributions
3. **Personal deductible contributions**
   - Would show here if you made after-tax contributions (you likely haven't)

**Red flags:**
- Annual contributions much less than expected ($22,000+)
- Missing months of contributions
- Contributions not being made to Aware Super

If you see discrepancies, contact your employer's payroll department.

## Sample Data Entry

Once you have your actual balances, update the Retirement Planner:

### Example for Steve:
```
Current Super Balance: $287,450
Fortnightly Contribution: $500
Current Annual Salary: $85,000
Long Service Leave Days: 65
```

### Example for Anne:
```
Current Super Balance: $265,890
Fortnightly Contribution: $500
Current Annual Salary: $80,000
Long Service Leave Days: 48
```

## Long Service Leave Days

**Where to find this:**
- Payslip (often shows accrued leave)
- HR/Payroll system portal
- Latest employee statement
- Contact HR directly

**Typical accrual:**
- 13 weeks (65 days) after 10 years service
- Additional 6.5 weeks (32.5 days) for each 5 additional years
- Check your specific award/employment agreement

**For the calculator:**
Enter total days available that you might take before retirement.

## Update Frequency

**Recommended updates:**
- **Monthly:** Quick check via Aware Super app
- **Quarterly:** Verify contributions are flowing correctly
- **Annually (July):** Full review when annual statement arrives
- **Before major decisions:** Always get current balance

## Quick Check Calculations

**Expected balance growth per year (roughly):**

Starting balance: $250,000
Annual contributions: $22,500
Investment return (7%): $17,500
Fees (0.6%): -$1,500
**Expected year-end:** ~$288,500

If your actual growth differs significantly:
- Check market performance (balanced funds typically 6-8% p.a.)
- Verify all contributions received
- Check for any unexpected fees
- Review investment option (default vs. chosen)

## Tax Return vs. Real-Time Balance

**Tax return balance (30 June):**
- Historical snapshot
- Used for tax purposes
- May be 3-6 months old by time you see it

**Current balance (today):**
- Real-time value
- Reflects recent market movements
- Includes recent contributions
- **Use this for retirement planning**
