# 🔧 EMERGENCY FIX APPLIED - App Restored to Working State

## ✅ Problem Solved

Your Budget Command Centre has been **restored to the last stable version** that worked perfectly.

## 🎯 What Was Wrong

The recent update that added 8 new financial planning modules (Tax Hub, Superannuation, Goals, Net Worth, Investments, Forecast, Financial Health, Insurance) introduced bugs that broke the entire application.

### The Issue:
1. Commit `e04632c` added 616+ lines of new code for 8 complex features
2. This code had bugs and wasn't fully tested
3. A follow-up "fix" removed `type="module"` but the broken code remained
4. Result: Nothing worked

### The Solution:
**Rolled back** to commit `8c9b1c5` (the last working version) and removed `type="module"` from that stable code.
