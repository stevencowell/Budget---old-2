# ‚úÖ Monthly Transaction Filter Feature - Implementation Complete

## What's New?

You can now **click on monthly statements to instantly view all transactions for that specific month**!

## Where to Find It

1. Navigate to **"Monthly Statements"** view (third tab in navigation)
2. Scroll down to the **"Monthly cashflow trend"** table
3. You'll now see TWO buttons in the "Actions" column for each month:
   - **"View Details"** - Opens the monthly statement summary (existing feature)
   - **"View Transactions"** - NEW! Filters transactions for that month

## How It Works

### Step-by-Step:
1. Click the **"View Transactions"** button next to any month (e.g., Nov 2024)
2. The app automatically:
   - Switches to the **Transactions** view
   - Sets the date filter to show only that month's transactions
   - Displays the count and total for that month

### Example:
Click "View Transactions" for **November 2024**:
- ‚úÖ Shows only transactions from Nov 1 - Nov 30, 2024
- ‚úÖ Date filters are pre-populated with Nov 1 and Nov 30
- ‚úÖ Transaction count shows: "X transactions" (only November's count)
- ‚úÖ Total shows: $X,XXX.XX (only November's total)

## Additional Features

Once in the Transactions view with the month filter applied, you can:
- **Search** by transaction description
- **Filter** by category (e.g., only show "Groceries & Dining")
- **Filter** by type (Income or Expense)
- **Clear filters** to see all transactions again
- **Further refine** the date range if needed
