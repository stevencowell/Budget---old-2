# Change Log - Critical Fix Applied

**Date:** September 30, 2025  
**Issue:** No data available in any feature  
**Status:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed JavaScript Module Loading Issue

**File:** `/workspace/web/index.html`  
**Line:** 1869  
**Type:** Bug Fix - Critical

#### Before (Broken):
```html
<script src="./main.js" type="module" data-json-path="../data/financial_overview.json"></script>
```

#### After (Fixed):
```html
<script src="./main.js" data-json-path="../data/financial_overview.json"></script>
```

#### Explanation:
The `type="module"` attribute was causing the JavaScript to execute in an isolated module scope, preventing the `init()` function from running properly. This blocked all data loading, leaving the UI empty despite having valid data files.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Problem:
ES6 module scripts execute in strict mode with their own scope, isolated from the global window object. The `main.js` file was not structured as a proper ES6 module with exports, so the `init()` function call at the end of the file was executing in module scope but couldn't access or affect the global scope needed for the application to function.

### Solution:
By removing the `type="module"` attribute, the script now executes in the global scope as a traditional script, allowing all functions to be properly accessible and the `init()` function to execute correctly, loading data and initializing all features.

### Prevention:
If ES6 modules are needed in the future, the entire `main.js` file would need to be refactored to:
1. Use proper `export` statements for all functions
2. Use `import` statements for dependencies
3. Export the `init` function
4. Initialize from a separate entry point or DOMContentLoaded event

---

## Rollback Procedure (If Needed)

To revert this change:
```bash
cd /workspace/web
# Edit index.html line 1869 to add back type="module"
sed -i 's|<script src="./main.js" data-json-path|<script src="./main.js" type="module" data-json-path|' index.html
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Not recommended** - This will break the application again.

## Additional Actions Taken

1. ‚úÖ Regenerated financial data from CSV files
2. ‚úÖ Started web server on port 8000
3. ‚úÖ Created verification script (`verify_fix.sh`)
4. ‚úÖ Created comprehensive documentation
5. ‚úÖ Made `start_server.sh` executable

---

## Next Steps for User

1. Open browser to: http://localhost:8000/web/
2. Explore all features with loaded data
3. Review AI Insights for financial recommendations
4. Update budget categories as needed
5. When new bank statements arrive, run:
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/generate_data.py
   ```
