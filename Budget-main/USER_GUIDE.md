## Tips & Best Practices

### Budget Management
1. **Start conservative**: Better to underestimate income and overestimate expenses
2. **Review monthly**: Update actuals and adjust budget categories
3. **Use categories**: Break down big categories into specific items
4. **Track variance**: Pay attention to items consistently over/under budget
5. **Save regularly**: Export your budget data monthly as backup

### Monthly Analysis
1. **Review insights**: The AI-generated insights often spot patterns you miss
2. **Compare trends**: Look at 3-6 months of data to see real patterns
3. **Target 20% savings rate**: This is a healthy benchmark for most families
4. **Investigate spikes**: Unusual months often reveal one-off expenses

### Financial Planning
1. **Model before acting**: Use calculators before making major decisions
2. **Be realistic**: Use conservative estimates for income, pessimistic for expenses
3. **Factor in inflation**: Add 2-3% to future expense estimates
4. **Emergency fund first**: Aim for 6 months expenses before investing
5. **Debt vs savings**: Generally pay off high-interest debt before saving

### Transaction Management
1. **Regular reviews**: Check transactions weekly to catch errors early
2. **Categorize accurately**: Proper categories make reports meaningful
3. **Search by merchant**: Find all transactions from specific vendors
4. **Use date ranges**: Compare spending in different periods
5. **Clean anomalies**: Edit or delete clearly wrong transactions

### Data Management
1. **Update regularly**: Download new transactions monthly
2. **Backup budget**: Export data before making major changes
3. **Keep history**: Archive old CSV files for future reference
4. **Document changes**: Note significant budget changes and why
