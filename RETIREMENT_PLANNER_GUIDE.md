# Comprehensive Retirement Planner - User Guide

## Overview

A comprehensive retirement planning calculator has been added to your Superannuation Tracker app. This tool is specifically designed for Steve and Anne to model different retirement scenarios and make informed decisions about:

- Long service leave timing
- Part-time work transitions
- Retirement age options
- Contribution strategies

## Your Details (Pre-populated)

**Steve:**
- Current Age: 54 (DOB: 17-02-1971)
- Years to retirement (at age 60): 6 years
- Fortnightly contribution: $500 (before tax)

**Anne:**
- Current Age: 55 (DOB: 10-04-1970)
- Years to retirement (at age 60): 5 years
- Fortnightly contribution: $500 (before tax)

## Key Features

### 1. Superannuation Balance Tracking
- Enter current super balances for both Steve and Anne
- The calculator uses your fortnightly $500 contributions (= $13,000 per year each)
- Placeholder values of $250,000 (Steve) and $220,000 (Anne) are pre-filled
- **Update these with actual values from your tax returns**

### 2. Long Service Leave Modeling
Long service leave is paid as ordinary salary, which means:
- Employer makes 11% superannuation guarantee contribution on LSL payments
- Enter available LSL days for each person
- Calculator shows the super boost from taking LSL

**Example:** If Steve has 60 days LSL at $85,000 salary:
- Daily rate: $85,000 / 260 = $327/day
- LSL payment: 60 days × $327 = $19,615
- Super contribution: $19,615 × 11% = $2,158

### 3. Part-Time Work Transitions
Model the impact of reducing work hours before full retirement:
- Set the age to start part-time work (e.g., age 58 or 59)
- Specify days per week (e.g., 4 days = 80%, 3 days = 60%)
- See how this affects final super balance
- Compare work-life balance trade-offs

**Scenarios to model:**
- Continue full-time until 60
- Reduce to 4 days/week from age 58
- Reduce to 3 days/week from age 59
- Take 6 months LSL, then go part-time

### 4. Retirement Income Projections
The calculator shows:
- **Combined super balance at retirement** (Steve + Anne)
- **Sustainable annual income** - calculated to last until your chosen life expectancy (default 90)
- **Monthly income** - your regular retirement income
- **Balance drawdown chart** - visual representation of super lasting through retirement

### 5. Scenario Comparison
Save multiple scenarios to compare side-by-side:
1. Adjust parameters (LSL days, part-time age, retirement age, etc.)
2. Click "Save as Scenario"
3. Repeat with different settings
4. View comparison table showing:
   - Individual balances
   - Combined totals
   - Annual retirement incomes
   - Side-by-side charts

## Investment Assumptions

### Default Settings (Adjustable)
- **Expected return:** 7% per annum
  - Typical for balanced super fund (6-8% historically)
  - Adjust based on your investment option
- **Inflation:** 2.5% per annum
  - Australian RBA target range
- **Admin fees:** 0.6% per annum
  - Check your Aware Super PDS for actual fees
- **Net real return:** 7% - 2.5% - 0.6% = 3.9% after inflation and fees

### Life Expectancy
- Default: 90 years
- Consider health, family history, lifestyle
- Australian averages: Men ~81, Women ~85
- Plan conservatively to avoid outliving savings

## Understanding the Results

### Income Target Indicators

**Green indicator (✓):**
- Your projected income exceeds desired income
- You're on track for comfortable retirement
- Consider if you can retire earlier or reduce contributions

**Yellow indicator (⚠️):**
- Projected income falls short of desired income
- Shows the annual shortfall amount
- Consider: work longer, increase contributions, reduce desired income, or factor in Age Pension

### Sustainable Income Calculation
The calculator uses present value annuity formula to ensure your money lasts:
- Accounts for investment returns during retirement
- Adjusts for inflation (real terms)
- Balances withdrawals with growth
- Money depletes to $0 exactly at life expectancy

## Tax Considerations

### Before Retirement (Accumulation Phase)
- Your $500 fortnightly contributions are **before-tax (salary sacrifice)**
- Reduces your taxable income (tax saving of ~30-37% depending on bracket)
- Super contributions taxed at 15% (much lower than personal rate)
- Highly tax-effective way to build retirement savings

### After Age 60 (Retirement Phase)
- Withdrawals from super are **completely tax-free** after age 60
- No tax on investment earnings in retirement phase
- All projected incomes in the calculator are tax-free

## Modeling Different Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Standard Retirement at 60
- Both work full-time until 60
- No LSL entered (save it for retirement travel fund)
- Maximum super accumulation
- Baseline for comparison

### Scenario 2: Phased Retirement with Part-Time
- Both reduce to 4 days/week at age 58
- Enjoy 52 extra days off per year before retirement
- Accept slightly lower super balance
- Better work-life balance

### Scenario 3: Long Service Leave Strategy
- Take all LSL in final year
- Boosts super by ~11% of LSL payment
- LSL paid out at full rate
- May push into higher tax bracket (consider timing)

### Scenario 4: Early Retirement at 58-59
- Adjust retirement age to 58 or 59
- See if your super supports earlier retirement
- Consider age pension eligibility (minimum 67 for you)
- May need to bridge the gap until pension age

### Scenario 5: Working to 62-65
- Model working a few extra years
- Significantly increases super balance
- Shorter retirement period (lower total income needed)
- May allow more comfortable lifestyle

## Pro Tips for Decision Making

### 1. Age Pension Consideration
This calculator doesn't include Age Pension:
- Eligibility age: 67 (for both of you)
- If you retire at 60, you have a 7-year gap
- Current maximum: ~$44,000/year combined (couple)
- Asset tested - your super counts once accessible
- Add Age Pension to your projected super income for total picture

### 2. Pre-Retirement Expenses
Working full-time has costs:
- Commuting, work clothes, lunches, etc.
- May save $5,000-10,000/year by not working
- Factor this into desired retirement income

### 3. Contribution Strategies
Before retirement, consider:
- Maximizing before-tax contributions (current: $30,000 cap)
- You contribute $13,000/year (well under cap)
- Could increase if financially viable
- Spouse contribution splitting for balance

### 4. Market Volatility
The calculator uses steady returns:
- Reality: markets fluctuate
- Consider stress-testing with lower returns (5-6%)
- Keep buffer in calculations
- Conservative estimates = better sleep

### 5. Health Considerations
- Private health insurance costs in retirement
- Potential aged care costs later
- Major health issue could impact plans
- Consider income protection until retirement

## How to Update Super Balances

Your super balances should be in your tax returns:

**Look for:**
- "Reportable employer super contributions"
- Annual statements from Aware Super
- MyGov > ATO > Super information

**Update the calculator:**
1. Enter Steve's current balance in "Steve's Details" section
2. Enter Anne's current balance in "Anne's Details" section
3. Recalculate to see updated projections

## Example Usage Walkthrough

### Question: "Should we go part-time at 58 or work full-time until 60?"

**Step 1:** Calculate baseline (full-time to 60)
- Steve: Keep all settings at default, 5 days/week until 60
- Anne: Keep all settings at default, 5 days/week until 60
- Click "Calculate Projection"
- Note the combined balance and annual income
- Click "Save as Scenario"

**Step 2:** Calculate part-time scenario
- Change Steve's "Part-Time Days per Week" to 4
- Change "Part-Time Work Start Age" to 58
- Change Anne's "Part-Time Days per Week" to 4
- Change "Part-Time Work Start Age" to 58
- Click "Calculate Projection"
- Note the combined balance and annual income
- Click "Save as Scenario"

**Step 3:** Compare
- Look at the scenario comparison table
- Calculate the difference in annual income
- Assess: Is the income reduction worth 104 extra days off per year (each)?
- Consider: 52 weeks × 2 years × 1 day = 104 days off for each of you

**Decision Framework:**
- If income difference < $5,000/year → Part-time is attractive
- If income difference > $15,000/year → Consider staying full-time
- Between $5-15K → Personal preference and lifestyle priorities

## Important Disclaimers

⚠️ **This calculator provides estimates only:**
- Not financial advice
- Actual returns will vary
- Market conditions change
- Personal circumstances differ

✓ **Recommended actions:**
1. Use this tool to explore options and understand trade-offs
2. Check actual super balances regularly
3. Consider consulting a licensed financial adviser
4. Review your retirement plan annually
5. Adjust strategies as circumstances change

## Technical Notes

### Calculation Methodology

**Accumulation Phase (Pre-Retirement):**
```
Annual Growth = Current Balance × (Return Rate - Fees)
Annual Contribution = Fortnightly × 26
Part-Time Adjustment = Contribution × (Days per Week / 5)
LSL Super Boost = (Salary / 260) × LSL Days × 11%
```

**Retirement Phase (Post-Retirement):**
```
Net Growth Rate = Return Rate - Fees - Inflation
Sustainable Income = Balance × Rate / (1 - (1 + Rate)^-Years)
```

This ensures money lasts exactly until life expectancy with consistent real income.
