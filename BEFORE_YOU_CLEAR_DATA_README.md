## 🎓 Understanding the System

### What's localStorage?
Your browser stores data locally:
- Survives page refreshes

- Cleared by "Clear All Data" button

### What Gets Exported?
Everything from localStorage:
```
cowell_budget_* → Budget data
tax_checklist_* → Tax progress
superannuation_* → Super data
```

### What's in the JSON?
Your backup file contains:
```json
{
  "budget": { your budget items },
  "scenarios": [ your scenarios ],
  "categoryChanges": { your changes },
  "subcategoryRules": [ your rules ],
  "taxChecklists": { your progress },
  "superannuationData": { your super info }
