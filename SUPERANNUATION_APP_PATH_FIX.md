# Superannuation App Path Fix

## The Issue
The superannuation button was pointing to the wrong URL, causing it to open the main budget overview page instead of the dedicated React superannuation tracker app.

## Root Cause
The superannuation button URL was missing the `/app/` path segment:
- **Incorrect:** `https://stevencowell.github.io/Budget---old-2/`
- **Correct:** `https://stevencowell.github.io/Budget---old-2/app/`

## The App DOES Exist!
Yes, there **is** a fully functional React superannuation tracker app built in `/workspace/client/` with the following features:

1. **Dashboard** - Overview of superannuation balance and projections
2. **Projection Calculator** - Long-term growth projections with compound interest
3. **Retirement Income** - Calculate retirement income based on balance and withdrawal strategy
4. **Tax Benefits** - Calculate tax savings from concessional contributions
5. **Minimum Drawdown** - Calculate minimum pension drawdown requirements

The app was just not accessible because the button URL was pointing to the wrong location.

## Files Changed

### 1. `/workspace/main.js` (Line 146)
**Before:**
```javascript
const superAppUrl = isLocal ? 'http://localhost:3000' : 'https://stevencowell.github.io/Budget---old-2/';
```

**After:**
```javascript
const superAppUrl = isLocal ? 'http://localhost:3000' : 'https://stevencowell.github.io/Budget---old-2/app/';
```

### 2. `/workspace/client/package.json` (Line 5)
**Before:**
```json
"homepage": "https://stevencowell.github.io/Budget---old-2",
```

**After:**
```json
"homepage": "https://stevencowell.github.io/Budget---old-2/app",
```

### 3. Documentation Updates
- Updated `GITHUB_PAGES_DEPLOYED.md` with correct URLs
- Updated `SUPERANNUATION_BUTTON_FIX.md` with correct URLs

## How It Works Now

### Deployment Structure
```
https://stevencowell.github.io/Budget---old-2/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html              (Main Budget App)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ styles.css
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.js
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ app/                    (React Superannuation Tracker)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ static/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

### Button Behavior
1. User clicks "üè¶ Superannuation Tracker" button
2. Button checks if running locally or in production
3. Opens the correct URL:
   - **Local:** `http://localhost:3000` (React dev server)
   - **Production:** `https://stevencowell.github.io/Budget---old-2/app/`
4. React app opens in a new tab with full functionality

## GitHub Actions Workflow
The `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` correctly builds and deploys both apps:
1. Builds the React app with `PUBLIC_URL: /superannuation/app`
2. Copies main budget app files to `deploy/`
3. Copies React build to `deploy/app/`
4. Deploys entire `deploy/` folder to GitHub Pages

## Next Deployment
After the next GitHub Actions workflow runs (triggered by push to main), the superannuation button will correctly open the React app at:

**https://stevencowell.github.io/Budget---old-2/app/**

**Fix Applied:** October 2, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Ready for Deployment
