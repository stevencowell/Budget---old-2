## Your Site URL

Your superannuation app should now be accessible at:

- **Main Budget App:** https://stevencowell.github.io/Budget---old-2/
- **Superannuation Tracker:** https://stevencowell.github.io/Budget---old-2/app/

## Important Notes

### Wait Time
- GitHub Pages can take **2-10 minutes** to activate after first deployment
- The site might show 404 initially, but it should work shortly

### GitHub Pages Settings
You need to verify that GitHub Pages is enabled in your repository settings:

1. Go to: https://github.com/stevencowell/Budget---old-2/settings/pages
2. Under "Source", ensure it says:
   - Branch: `gh-pages`
   - Folder: `/ (root)`
3. Click "Save" if needed

### If Still Not Working

If after 10 minutes the site still shows 404:

1. Check GitHub Pages settings (link above)
2. Verify the gh-pages branch exists: https://github.com/stevencowell/Budget---old-2/tree/gh-pages
3. Look for any error messages in the Pages settings

### Future Deployments

To update the site in the future, simply run:
```bash
cd client
npm run deploy
```

This will rebuild and redeploy automatically.

## Current Branch Structure

- `main` - Source code
- `cursor/troubleshoot-item-not-opening-aa9b` - Current working branch
