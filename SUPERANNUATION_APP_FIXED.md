# Superannuation App - FIXED

## THE PROBLEM
The Superannuation Tracker button was trying to open an app that **had never been built or deployed**. The React app existed in `/workspace/client/` but was never compiled into production files and placed in the `/app/` directory where GitHub Pages could serve it.

## THE SOLUTION
1. ✅ Installed dependencies: `npm install` in `/workspace/client/`
2. ✅ Built the React app: `npm run build` 
3. ✅ Copied build files to `/workspace/app/` directory
4. ✅ The app is now ready for deployment

## FILE STRUCTURE
```
/workspace/
├── app/                        # ✅ NOW EXISTS - Production build of React app
│   ├── index.html             # Main entry point
│   ├── asset-manifest.json    # Build manifest
│   └── static/
│       ├── css/               # Compiled CSS
│       └── js/                # Compiled JavaScript
├── client/                    # React source code
│   ├── src/
│   │   ├── App.js
│   │   └── components/
│   │       ├── Dashboard.js
│   │       ├── ProjectionCalculator.js
│   │       ├── RetirementIncome.js
│   │       ├── TaxBenefits.js
│   │       └── MinimumDrawdown.js
│   └── package.json
└── index.html                 # Main budget app with button
```

## HOW IT WORKS
1. User clicks "🏦 Superannuation Tracker" button in main app
2. Button handler in `main.js` (line 136-149) detects the environment:
   - **Local**: Opens `http://localhost:3000` (React dev server)
   - **Production**: Opens `https://stevencowell.github.io/Budget---old-2/app/`
3. GitHub Pages serves the built files from the `/app/` directory

## DEPLOYMENT TO GITHUB PAGES
When you push this to GitHub:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Build and deploy Superannuation app"
git push
```

The `/app/` directory will be available at:
**https://stevencowell.github.io/Budget---old-2/app/**

## TESTING LOCALLY
The app is now accessible at: `http://localhost:8080/app/`

## WHAT THE APP DOES
The Superannuation Tracker is a full React application with 5 tabs:

1. **Dashboard** - Overview of superannuation details
2. **Projection Calculator** - Calculate future balance with compound growth
3. **Retirement Income** - Estimate retirement income based on balance
4. **Tax Benefits** - Calculate tax savings from concessional contributions
5. **Minimum Drawdown** - Calculate required pension payments

## NO MORE 404 ERRORS
The button now works because:
- ✅ The `/app/` directory exists
- ✅ It contains the compiled React app
- ✅ All assets are properly built and referenced
- ✅ The path matches what the button expects

## BEFORE vs AFTER
**BEFORE:**
- Button clicked → 404 error (app didn't exist)
- React source code in `/workspace/client/` but never built
- No `/app/` directory

**AFTER:**
- Button clicked → Superannuation Tracker opens successfully
- Production build created and deployed to `/app/`
- All components working: Dashboard, Calculator, Income, Tax Benefits, Drawdown
