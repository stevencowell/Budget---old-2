## 💡 Key Calculations Explained

### 1. Superannuation Growth (Pre-Retirement)
```javascript
For each year until retirement:
  Starting Balance
  + Investment Return (balance × returnRate)
  - Fees (balance × feeRate)
  + Annual Contributions (fortnightly × 26)
  × Part-Time Adjustment (if applicable)
  + LSL Super Boost (first year only)
  = End Year Balance
```

### 2. Long Service Leave Super Contribution
```javascript
Daily Salary = Annual Salary ÷ 260 working days
LSL Payment = Daily Salary × LSL Days
Super Contribution = LSL Payment × 11% (employer SG rate)
Boosted Amount = Super Contribution × (1 + growth)^years_remaining
```

### 3. Part-Time Impact
```javascript
Part-Time Ratio = Days per Week ÷ 5
Adjusted Contribution = Normal Contribution × Part-Time Ratio
Applied from: Part-Time Start Age → Retirement Age
```

### 4. Sustainable Retirement Income
```javascript
Net Real Return = Return Rate - Fees - Inflation
Years in Retirement = Life Expectancy - Retirement Age

Sustainable Annual Income = 
  Balance × NetRealReturn / (1 - (1 + NetRealReturn)^(-Years))

This is the Present Value Annuity formula ensuring:
- Consistent real income (inflation-adjusted)
- Balance reaches $0 exactly at life expectancy
- Accounts for ongoing investment growth
```

### 5. Monthly Income
```javascript
Monthly Income = Annual Income ÷ 12
```
