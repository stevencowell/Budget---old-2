### Calculation Methodology

**Pre-Retirement (Accumulation):**
```
For each year until retirement:
  1. Apply investment return to current balance
  2. Deduct fees
  3. Add annual contributions (fortnightly × 26)
  4. Adjust contributions if part-time (× days/5)
  5. Add LSL super boost in first year (if applicable)
  6. Compound growth to retirement
```

**At Retirement:**
```
Combined Balance = Steve's Final + Anne's Final
```

**During Retirement (Drawdown):**
```
Sustainable Income = Present Value Annuity Formula
  Balance × (real return rate) / (1 - (1 + real return rate)^-years)
  
Where:
  real return rate = return - fees - inflation
  years = life expectancy - retirement age
  
This ensures balance reaches $0 exactly at life expectancy
```

**Long Service Leave Impact:**
```
Daily Salary = Annual Salary / 260 working days
LSL Payment = Daily Salary × LSL Days
Super Contribution = LSL Payment × 11% (employer SG)
Boost = Super Contribution × (1 + growth rate)^years to retirement
```

**Part-Time Impact:**
```
Part-Time Ratio = Days per Week / 5
Adjusted Contribution = Normal Contribution × Part-Time Ratio
Applied from part-time start age to retirement age
```

## 💡 Key Insights & Recommendations

### What the Numbers Will Likely Show

**Based on typical super balances and your contribution levels:**

**Baseline (Full-Time Until 60):**
- Combined balance: ~$700,000-$800,000
- Annual income: ~$44,000-$50,000
- Monthly income: ~$3,700-$4,200

**This should comfortably support retirement, especially with Age Pension from 67.**

### Decision Frameworks

**Question 1: Should we go part-time?**

**Calculate the cost per extra day off:**
- Full-time income: $X/year
- Part-time income: $Y/year
- Difference: $(X-Y) = cost over remaining life
- Extra days off: 52 days/year × years until retirement × people
- Cost per day: $(X-Y) / extra days

**If cost per day < $50:** Part-time is excellent value
**If cost per day > $100:** Consider staying full-time
**Between $50-$100:** Personal preference

**Question 2: Should we bank our LSL?**

**LSL super boost:** ~$2,000-$3,000 per person
**LSL cash (after tax):** ~$12,000-$15,000 per person

**Bank in super if:**
- Don't need the cash
- Want to maximize retirement income
- Already have emergency funds
- In high tax bracket (more effective)

**Take as cash if:**
- Need funds for specific purpose
- Want retirement travel fund
- Like having accessible money
- Want to bridge to pension age (67)

**Recommendation:** For most people, taking LSL as cash provides more flexibility.

**Question 3: When should we retire?**

**Retire earlier (58-59) if:**
- Health concerns
- Strong desire to stop working
- Have other income sources
- Comfortable with lower income

**Retire on target (60) if:**
- Balanced approach
- Good health and job satisfaction
- Want solid retirement income
- Original plan still makes sense

**Retire later (61-63) if:**
- Love your job
- Want maximum financial security
- Good health and energy
- Want to help kids financially

**Recommendation:** Review at age 57-58 based on:
- How you're feeling about work
- Your health status
- Super balance vs projections
- What you want to do in retirement

## 💬 Common Questions Answered

**Q: Do I need to enter everything?**
A: Only super balances are critical. Other fields have sensible defaults, but more accurate inputs = better projections.

**Q: Can I save my scenarios?**
A: Yes! Click "Save as Scenario" and they're stored in the browser session. Note: Refreshing the page clears them. Model all scenarios in one session.

**Q: What if I want to model more complex scenarios?**
A: The calculator handles: different ages, part-time transitions, LSL, various retirement ages. For more complex situations (inheritance, property sales, etc.), consult a financial adviser.

**Q: How accurate are the projections?**
A: Calculations are mathematically accurate based on inputs. However, actual returns will vary. Use conservative estimates (6% return) for safer projections.

**Q: What return rate should I use?**
A: 
- Conservative: 5-6% p.a.
- Moderate: 6-7% p.a.
- Growth: 7-8% p.a.
Check your Aware Super investment option's historical returns.

**Q: Should I factor in Age Pension?**
A: Yes! The calculator doesn't include this, but from age 67 you'll likely get $5,000-$15,000/year extra. This is a significant boost to retirement income.

**Q: What about taxes?**
A: Great news! After age 60, super withdrawals are tax-free. All income projections in retirement are tax-free. Your $500 contributions are before-tax (saving you 30-37% tax now).

**Q: What if we retire at different ages?**
A: The calculator uses a single retirement age for both. To model different ages, run two separate scenarios and manually combine the results, or retire together at the later age.

**Q: Can I share these scenarios with my partner?**
A: The best way is to show them on screen together. You could also screenshot the comparison table or write down the key figures.
