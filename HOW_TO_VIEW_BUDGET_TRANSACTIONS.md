## Tips and Tricks

### Tip 1: Quick Navigation
After viewing transactions, use the **"Budget Manager"** tab to go back to your budget overview. The filters will be preserved until you clear them or click another budget item.

### Tip 2: Refine Your View
After clicking a budget item, you can:
- Adjust the date range to see specific time periods
- Use the search box to narrow down to specific merchants
- Sort transactions by clicking column headers (if implemented)

### Tip 3: Use Action Buttons Independently
The Edit, Duplicate, and Delete buttons on each budget row work independently. Clicking them won't trigger the transaction view.

### Tip 4: Clear Filters
To see all transactions again, click the **"Clear Filters"** button in the Transactions view.

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: No Transactions Shown
**Solution:** The budget item might not have any matching transactions. Check:
- The category name matches transaction categories
- Transactions exist in the selected category
- Date filters aren't excluding all transactions

### Problem: Too Many Transactions
**Solution:** If you see more transactions than expected:
- The search filter matches partial text (e.g., "Gas" matches "Gas/Electricity")
- Use additional filters to narrow down the results
- Check the transaction category/subcategory assignments

### Problem: Click Not Working
**Solution:** Make sure you're not clicking:
- On an action button (Edit, Duplicate, Delete)
- Outside the table row
- On a row with no data
