# Summary of Changes to Fix 404 Error

## Problem
The Superannuation Tracker button was showing a 404 error because:
1. GitHub Pages was not properly configured
2. No automated deployment workflow existed
3. The React app wasn't being built and deployed

## Solution Implemented

### Files Created

1. **`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`**
   - GitHub Actions workflow for automated deployment
   - Builds both the main app and React client
   - Deploys everything to GitHub Pages
   - Runs automatically on every push to main branch

2. **`DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`**
   - Comprehensive guide for setting up and managing deployments
   - Troubleshooting tips
   - Local development instructions

3. **`QUICK_FIX.md`**
   - Simple 2-step guide to enable GitHub Pages
   - Quick reference for fixing the 404 error

4. **`CHANGES_SUMMARY.md`** (this file)

### Files Modified

   - Updated the superannuation button click handler
   - Changed production URL from `/superannuation` to `/superannuation/app`

## Deployment Structure

After deployment, the site structure will be:

```
https://stevencowell.github.io/superannuation/
├── index.html              (Main Budget Command Centre)
├── styles.css
├── main.js
├── data/
│   └── financial_overview.json
└── app/                    (React Superannuation Tracker)
    ├── index.html
    ├── static/
    │   ├── css/
    │   └── js/
    └── ...
```

## What You Need to Do

### Required: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to repository Settings → Pages
2. Set Source to "GitHub Actions"
3. Save

### Required: Push Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Set up GitHub Pages deployment"
git push origin main
```

### Wait for Deployment

- Go to Actions tab to watch progress
- Takes 3-5 minutes for first deployment
- Green checkmark = success

## Testing

After deployment completes:

1. Visit: https://stevencowell.github.io/superannuation/
2. Click "🏦 Superannuation Tracker" button
3. Should open React app at: https://stevencowell.github.io/superannuation/app/

## Future Deployments

Every time you push to the main branch:
- GitHub Actions automatically runs
- Builds and deploys both apps
- No manual intervention needed

## Rollback

If something goes wrong, you can:
1. Go to Actions tab
2. Click on a previous successful workflow run
3. Click "Re-run all jobs"

Or revert the commits:
```bash
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
```

## Notes

- First deployment may take longer (5-10 minutes)
- Browser caching may require hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)
- Changes take effect within 2-3 minutes after workflow completes
- The workflow only runs on main branch (can be changed in deploy.yml)
