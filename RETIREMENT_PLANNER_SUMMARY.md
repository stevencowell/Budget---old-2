## üí° Key Insights from the Calculator

### Your Retirement Income (Approximate Ranges)

Based on typical super balances for your age and contribution levels:

**Scenario A: Full-time until 60**
- Combined balance: ~$700,000-$750,000
- Annual income: ~$44,000-$47,000
- Monthly income: ~$3,700-$3,900

**Scenario B: Part-time (4 days) from 58**
- Combined balance: ~$680,000-$720,000
- Annual income: ~$42,000-$45,000
- Monthly income: ~$3,500-$3,750
- **Trade-off:** ~$2,000/year for 104 extra days off (each)

**Scenario C: Work until 63**
- Combined balance: ~$900,000-$950,000
- Annual income: ~$56,000-$60,000
- Monthly income: ~$4,700-$5,000
- **Bonus:** ~$12,000/year extra for 3 more years work

### Age Pension Boost (Not in Calculator)

At age 67, you'll likely qualify for Age Pension:
- Homeowner couple: Up to ~$44,000/year combined
- Part pension likely given super balances
- Adds ~$5,000-$15,000/year to your income
- Provides safety net if super runs low

**Total retirement income** = Super drawdown + Age Pension

### The Part-Time Work Question

**Is going part-time worth it?**

Let's say it costs $2,000/year in retirement income:
- 2 years part-time = 104 extra days off each
- Cost: ~$19 per day of freedom
- Compare to: Taking unpaid leave costs ~$327/day (daily salary)
- **Part-time is extremely cost-effective** for work-life balance

### The Long Service Leave Decision

**Bank in super or take as cash?**

**Banking LSL (65 days Steve, 50 days Anne):**
- Super boost: ~$5,000 combined
- Extra annual income: ~$300/year in retirement
- Locked until retirement

**Taking as Cash:**
- After-tax cash: ~$24,000 combined
- Available for immediate use:
  - Retirement travel fund
  - Home renovations
  - Emergency buffer
  - Bridge to age pension (67)

**Recommendation:** Take as cash for flexibility unless you don't need it.

## üîß Technical Details

### Calculator Methodology

**Accumulation Phase (Pre-Retirement):**
```
Each year:
1. Calculate growth on current balance (return rate - fees)
2. Add annual contributions ($500 √ó 26 = $13,000)
3. Adjust contributions if part-time (proportion of days worked)
4. Add LSL super contribution if applicable (11% of LSL payment)
5. Repeat for each year until retirement
```

**Retirement Phase (Post-Retirement):**
```
Sustainable Income Calculation:
- Net real return = Return rate - Fees - Inflation
- Uses annuity formula: PMT = PV √ó r / (1 - (1 + r)^-n)
- Where: PV = present value (super balance)
         r = net real return rate
         n = years until life expectancy
- Result: Income that depletes balance to $0 at life expectancy
```

**This ensures:**
- Consistent real income (adjusted for inflation)
- Money lasts exactly until life expectancy
- Accounts for continued investment growth during retirement

### Data Validation
The calculator includes:
- Minimum/maximum age constraints
- Logical checks (can't retire before current age)
- Part-time work limited to 0.5-5 days per week
- All monetary values validated as numbers
